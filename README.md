Code sample

## Prerequisites

### Minimum requirements

* Sample requires **Python 3**. Python 2 is not supported.
* virtualenv is required to run the sample; virtualenvwrapper is suggested

## Quickstart

To test the sample, execute the following (for example):
```
    $ tox -e py39,pep8
```
Sample can run the tests on python versions 3.7, 3.8 and/or 3.9 (py37, py38 and py39 respectively).

The pep8 tox environment will test code style enforcement.
